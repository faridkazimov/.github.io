    - title: <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">Automatic Animal and Crowd Counting</a>
      year: 2025
      description: 
        - Developed a computer vision system using YOLOv8 with heatmap and density maps for counting animals and people in dense environments. Validated on datasets including sheep, bees, cows, monkeys, butterflies, and humans.
        - YOLOv8 • OpenCV • Heatmap and Density Maps • Computer Vision
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">Transfer Learning for Crowded Animals Detection</a>
      year: 2025
      description: 
        - Applied transfer learning to adapt YOLOv8 models trained on one species to others (e.g., cows, monkeys, butterflies). Cross-class fine-tuning improved generalization and reduced training data requirements for scalable deployment.
        - Transfer Learning • Fine-Tuning • Cross-Class Generalization • Domain Adaptation
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">YOLO Version Comparison (YOLOv3 -> YOLO12)</a>
      year: 2025
      description: 
        - Benchmarking YOLO models for detecting animals in crowded herds, focusing on accuracy, inference speed, occlusion robustness, and cross-species generalization.
        - YOLOv3–YOLOv8+ • Backbone Comparison • Anchor-Free Detection • Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) • Inference Speed and Latency • Model Optimization (Quantization, Pruning)
